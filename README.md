# MischMart1

**Introduction**

MischMart is a small retail application that intends to let the user do the following:

- Browse products by categories
- Log in using OpenID
- Add products to his cart
- Checkout using the popular Stripes application.

**Design and implementation**

I started the project by exploring [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and other retail apps on the web such as [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com) to try and draw inspiration from these. This permitted me to land a simple visual design with basic functionalities. 

After this stage, I scaffolded my express application using the application generation tool (*express-generator*).
